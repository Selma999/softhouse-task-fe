## Project description

#### Introduction
Instead of using create-react-app for generating the project, I used **vite**. Reason for this is because create-react-app is considered deprecated, and **vite** is the new preferred method in **React** appliations.

#### How to start
In command line type: `npm run dev` & you are ready to go! ** You do not need to have **vite** installed, it installs in the background. **

#### Api library
I have used **Axios** library for data fetching in this application. **Axios** is considered as the best practice regarding APIs in **React** applications. It has to be installed in order to be used and the installation is made with the following command in command line: `npm i react-axios`

#### Formik library
To create and handle the form, I have used **Formik** Library, which has to be installed in order to be used.
The installation is made with the following command in command line: `npm install formik --save`
